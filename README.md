# VLAN-Simulation-using-GNS3
With the use of c3640 router image and the NM-16ESW adapter for handling additional VLAN Connections, I have simulated a basic configuration for VLAN with the code on the side and network labeled. This basic configuration can be expanded into more complex patterns but it establishes the basis for creating a Virtual LAN withing the readily available tool GNS3
